# Weather-Journal App Project

This project is presenting a simple UI showing today's date, current temperature, and a feedback from the user of how he is feeling.

This is all gathered and represented on a localhost 8000 using the node.js tools, a pretty powerful pack, which allows us to use our device as a local
server.

For this we have server.js, app.js, index.html and css syncing together using async and fetch, which also presents await, try, catch and .then(promises).

Using open weather map API, it was possible to attain the current updated temperature reading using your zip code(here) or other ways you can check
on openweathermap.org.

Enjoy your ride!
